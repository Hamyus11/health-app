# AI Coding Agent Instructions - Girls in Science Project

## Project Overview
This is a "Girls in Science" educational project. Update this file as the project structure becomes clear.

## Getting Started with This Codebase
1. Review the main README.md (when created) for project goals
2. Check for a `docs/` or `architecture/` folder to understand system design
3. Look at existing tests to understand patterns and conventions

## Code Organization
*TBD: Document as structure emerges*
- **Source code location**: TBD
- **Test location**: TBD
- **Configuration files**: TBD

## Build & Development Workflow
*TBD: Add actual build commands once project is scaffolded*

## Testing Conventions
*TBD: Document how to run tests*

## Key Development Patterns
*TBD: Add project-specific conventions*

## Common Files & Their Purposes
*TBD: Document key files as they are created*

## Integration Points
*TBD: Document external dependencies and APIs*

## Important Notes
- This file will be updated as the project takes shape
- Focus on documenting discovered patterns, not aspirational practices
